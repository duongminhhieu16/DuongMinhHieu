# Answer question (a) or (b), but not both, depending on your background.
* (a) If you do, or have, worked for a software development company, what level of test maturity do you think the company worked at? (0: testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness, 2: testing shows the program doesn’t work, 3: testing reduces risk, 4: testing is a mental discipline about quality).
* (b) If you have never worked for a software development company, what level of test maturity do you think that you have? (0: testing=debugging, 1: testing shows correctness, 2: testing shows the program doesn’t work, 3: testing reduces risk, 4: testing is a mental discipline about quality).

# Answer:
I have worked for a software development company: Early Start. I think they have been at level 3. I could see testers and developers having the same goals: reduce the risks. They worked together really well.
