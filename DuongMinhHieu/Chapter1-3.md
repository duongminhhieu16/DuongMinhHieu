* "Level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk" means that we don't test to know the software is behaving right (or wrong). Risks is maybe still there, hiding inside the software. Sometimes risks appears when we use software, big or small, and we accept them, which is when both developers and testers work together to reduce risk.
* "Risk" is an expectation of loss, a potential problem that may or may not occur in the future. A possibility of suffering from loss in software development process is called a software risk. Reduce risk means reduce the probability of risk. Risk simply is a loss/problem which may appear when we incur a fault.
* We cannot reduce the risk to zero. We can never know whether a software has faults or not. Nothing is perfect. We just can reduce the probability of incurring faults. As saying above, risks is maybe still there, we can't know for sure.
