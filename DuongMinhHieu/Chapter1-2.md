Difference between software fault and software failure:
* Software fault: A static defect in the software. It means that software fault is the reason, the main cause that leads to misbehaviours in software. Fault is where software doesn't cover all the requirements or cover wrong problem.
* Software failure: External, incorrect behaviour with respect to the requirements or other description of the expected behaviour. It means that software failure is the misbehaviour of the software.
